# PDM-Project
Code for planning algorithm with dubins path and RRT*

This code is made for the project assignement of the course Planning and Decision making 21/22
The script will compute the shortest route from a starting point to a goal point using dubins path and RRT* 

# Running the code

Run file ```rrt_star_dubins.py``` to run the full code.
For selecting the different maps edit the main of file ```rrt_star_dubins.py``` to either of these options

- ```maps = Maps(1),obstacles = obstacles_simple```
- ```maps = Maps(2),obstacles = obstacles_medium```
- ```maps = Maps(3),obstacles = obstacles_hard```
